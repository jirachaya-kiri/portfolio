                <p class="page-title">Hello! I'm Jirachaya.</p>
                <p class="page-text-contd">I’m an amigurumi knitter, indulgent fiction reader, and former barista-who-doesn't-drink-coffee. Also, a UX designer at Twitch.</p>
                
                <p data-aos="fade-in" class="text-title">Why product design?</p>
                <p data-aos="fade-in" data-aos="fade-in" class="page-text-contd">At the age of 3, my dream job was art gallery owner. It still sounds cool, but I realized I want to do something more impactful for everyday people–not just those who choose to spend their freetime at museums. Those people are cool too, though. </p>
                <p data-aos="fade-in" class="page-text-contd">At 12, my dream job was book designer. I loved reading, and the covers, illustrations, and even fonts felt like the closest a story got to being tangible. I have a Goodreads shelf called books-that-deserve-better-covers. Around this age, I also got into making silly collages with my friends on PicCollage, which I still consider my first steps toward graphic design.
                </p>
                <p data-aos="fade-in" class="page-text-contd">At 17, I took a class on Photoshop and Illustrator, and fell in love with graphic design. That led to a job in my city’s Recreation Department, where I made posters to the tunes of Spotify playlists with names like “how to reduce file size pdf”. I still love graphic design, but I wanted to be more involved in people’s experiences outside of the 2D visuals I was making.</p>
                <p data-aos="fade-in" class="page-text-contd">When I heard of product design and UX/UI, I realized it is exactly what I’ve been looking for. It blends my love for aesthetics with the ability to impact functionality, and allows me to truly makie at least a tiny part of people’s lives better.
                </p>
                <!-- <p data-aos="fade-in" class="page-text-contd">Right now, I want any experience I can with product design, but I would like to pursue a career improving the experience of crucial services. This is all the boring, dry stuff like experiences at the DMV, hospital websites, banking apps–anything that people need to use, but might not necessarily want to. It’s the best way I can see to apply my personal interests and talents to making the world a little bit better!</p> -->
                <p data-aos="fade-in" class="text-title">Outside of product design...</p>
                <p data-aos="fade-in" class="page-text-contd">I’m also very passionate about personal finances and money management. Growing up low-income, I’ve always been practical with money, and I had a job as a peer financial wellness educator where I took appointments and taught people about personal finance topics. I have a lot of opinions about investing, and I hope to one day create a redesign of Fidelity’s website.
                </p>
                <p data-aos="fade-in" class="page-text-contd">I love art and illustration, and do it to both wind down and get excited about a new project. I still read, though I’ve moved on from the YA romances, mostly. I’m an avid knitter and crocheter, and while I've created a few sweaters, my favorite projects are amigurumi. I’ve also dipped my toes into other crafty stuff like bookbinding. If it’s an activity that ruins your eyesight, you can bet I’ll do it for hours, most likely while listening to musical theater recordings. You can find me speedwalking around the Bay pretending I’m a frazzled New York creative in a show like Broad City or 30 Rock.</p>
