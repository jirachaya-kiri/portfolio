                <p data-aos="fade-in" class="page-text-contd">Twitch works using Amazon IVS, a live interactive video streaming service that also allows other companies to build and run their own live streaming platforms. 
                    Many customers want to use IVS to build bullet chat, a type of chat in which messages scroll across the screen.
                    My internship project was to design, prototype, and build a bullet chat demo using IVS.
                    </p>

                <p data-aos="fade-in" class="text-title-2">Context</p>
                <p data-aos="fade-in" class="page-text-contd">Twitch works using <strong>Amazon IVS</strong>, a live interactive video streaming service that also allows other companies to build and run their own live streaming platforms.
                    The IVS Chat product, released earlier this year, is popular among our customers.
                    </p>
                <p data-aos="fade-in" class="text-title-2">The Problem</p>
                <p data-aos="fade-in" class="page-text-contd">Many customers want to use IVS to build <strong>bullet chat</strong>, a type of chat in which messages scroll across the screen rather than being contained on the side.
                    However, it’s not immediately clear how IVS can be used to do so, design- or engineering-wise.
                    </p>
                <p data-aos="fade-in" class="text-title-2">My Role</p>
                <p data-aos="fade-in" class="page-text-contd">My project was to <strong>design, prototype, and build a bullet chat demo</strong> using IVS.
                    The outcome of this project was code published open source on github and a demo to be hosted on <a class="text-link" href="https://bulletchat.ivsdemos.com/">ivs.rocks</a>, which also hosts other demos created by my team. This is available for customers to use on their own, and to our sales team when they present to customers.

                <p data-aos="fade-in" class="text-title" id="short-margin">Design process</p>
                <p data-aos="fade-in" class="page-text-contd">Before starting, I did some research on existing bullet chat implementations on sites known for bullet chat like BiliBili and Niconico and also through extensions that add bullet chat to Youtube and Twitch.  
                    Once I started designing this demo, I had some constraints and goals in mind.</p>
                <p data-aos="fade-in" class="page-text-contd">Overall, I was creating a responsive, self-contained bullet chat app demo that works on both desktop and mobile.</p>
                <ul data-aos="fade-in" class="page-text-contd">
                    <li> It had to be <strong>simple</strong>, so that it highlighted the key actions of sending bullet chat messages and watching them scroll across the video.</li>
                    <li>It also needed to be <strong>engaging</strong> and <strong>delightful</strong>, so users enjoy using it and see that bullet chat is fun and worth implementing</li>
                </ul>
                <p data-aos="fade-in" class="page-text-contd">I started by sketching out possible layouts and brainstorming different features and functions I wanted it to have, keeping simplicity, engagingness, and delight in mind.</p>
                
                <p data-aos="fade-in" class="text-title">Final Mockups</p>

                <p data-aos="fade-in" class="page-text-contd">I made three key changes to achieve these goals.</p>
                <p data-aos="fade-in" class="text-title-2">Combining and creating pages</p>
                <p data-aos="fade-in" class="page-text-contd">The addition of a footer eliminates the need for a “Contact Us” page. Small or obscure pages like “CDs” and “Gifts-in-Kind” were also combined with other pages, while new pages like “Our Values” provided crucial information about accessibility and other topics.</p>

                        <p data-aos="fade-in" class="page-text-contd">A countdown timer is constantly on the screen to remind users that a popup will soon appear. The popup tells the user how long they've been on the site, and presents a division problem.</p>

                    <p data-aos="fade-in" class="page-text-contd">Each time the popup appears, it includes one addition division problem and is a darker shade of red. The longer users are on a site, the more they have to work to continue using it. This also stops them from becoming used to the level of inconvenience of the popup, since it takes longer to complete each time.</p>

                <p data-aos="fade-in" class="page-text-contd">My focus with the project was more on functionality, so I did not try to rebrand their website. Rather, I wanted to make it easy to scan and read. I gave all pages the standard format of a banner image followed by a centered column of text. Keeping their dark mode aesthetics, I chose a gray for the text that would be easier on the eyes, and adjusted font size and spacing so that long text would not be as overwhelming.</p>

                <p data-aos="fade-in" class="text-title-2">👤 Always keep the user in mind</p>
                <p data-aos="fade-in" class="page-text-contd">Initially, I kept trying to design for the user of an actual bullet chat app, but I later realized I should be designing it for the specific users of this demo—customer companies and their developers, who need to be able to picture themselves building something like this, and our sales team, who need to feel empowered to use the demo.</p>
                <p data-aos="fade-in" class="text-title-2">🐱 Stay curious</p>
                <p data-aos="fade-in" class="page-text-contd">I had never heard of bullet chat even though it’s huge in other countries and I find it to be a really engaging experience. I want to continue exploring to keep up with new trends and also learn about things that have been around for a while but just haven’t been on my radar.</p>
                <p data-aos="fade-in" class="text-title-2">🏗️ Design doesn't end at the mockups</p>
                <p data-aos="fade-in" class="page-text-contd">This project was a good reminder that design goes beyond just making static mock ups and sending them to engineers. Interactivity is a big part of how it feels to use the product, and that’s found mainly in how the design is implemented. I’m happy I was able to go from envisioning something to fully realizing it and publishing it</p>
